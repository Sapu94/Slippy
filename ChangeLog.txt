v1.4	-Quick Auctions API implemented!
	-Wrote functions to deal with the QAAPI as well as deal with itemLinks.
	-Added a new row to all the data arrays where the itemID of the scroll is stored.
	-Added slippyData which will eventually replace the 9 individual data tables. For now,
	it simply contains the 9 data tables which allows them to be acessed in the same manner
	as before as well as through the slippyData array without conflict.
	-Converted everything inside of the core.lua file to use slippyData instead of the old arrays.
	-Matched the order of the arrays in data.lua to the rest of the program for consistency.
	-Added a warning if QAAPI is not loaded (currently does not do anything besides print the warning).

v1.3	-Multiple adjustments to the core.lua file to improve the code.
	-More variables defined as locals and some variables renamed / moved as a result.

v1.2	-Added new rows for the arrays in data.lua to handle extra materials. As a result,
	everything that used these arrays was updated (mainly core.lua).
	-Stored the totals in the DB. As a result everything that used the totals array was updated (mainly gui.lua).
	-Improved the slash commands greater by making "/sl" print out list of slash commands.
	-Added an option to enable / disabled vellums.
	-Cleaned up the core.lua code by putting the Get and Set function for the options in the options function.
	-Moved the default profile values to the data.lua file.

v1.1 	-Fixed a bug where glove enchants were not being reset when the "Reset Craft Queue" button was pressed.
	-Greatly improved the documentation of the code by adding comments throughout.
	-Cleaned up the code overall by getting rid of unused/unncessary functions/variables.
