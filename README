Slippy now uses the QAAPI (part of /QuickAuctions/modules/scan.lua) to get scan data from Quick Auctions 3.
The version of QA3 that contains this API will not go live until WoW client patch 3.3.3.

In order to allow Slippy to use the QAAPI before it goes live, you must make the following modifications
to your version of Quick Auctions:

1. Navigate to the QuickAuctions directory inside your /World of Warcraft/Interface/Addons folder.
2. Open up the modeules folder.
3. Open scan.lua in an editor (Notepad will work fine).
4. Add the following code to the very end of the file:

-- Simple data API
QAAPI = {}
function QAAPI:GetData(itemLink)
	if( not itemLink ) then return end
	itemLink = QuickAuctions:GetSafeLink(itemLink)
 
	return auctionData[itemLink]
end


5. File->Save to save the changes. You should now see "Loaded Slippy v1.5 and QAAPI successfully!"
and all QAAPI features should be enabled and work properly when you log into wow with Slippy enabled.
